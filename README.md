# Mojo for Visual Studio Code

[![Build extension](https://github.com/modular/mojo-vscode/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/modular/mojo-vscode/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

This VS Code extension from the Modular team adds support for the
[Mojo programming language](https://www.modular.com/mojo).

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for `.mojo` and `.🔥` files
- Code completion
- Code diagnostics and quick fixes
- Full LSP experience for doc string code blocks
- Go to symbol
- API docs on hover
- Code formatting
- Run Mojo file

## Get started

1. Install the Mojo SDK.
2. Install the Mojo VS Code extension.
3. Open any `.mojo` or `.🔥` file.

## Configuration

The extension will attempt to find the path of the Mojo SDK installation using
the `MODULAR_HOME` environment variable. If `MODULAR_HOME` is not set within
the environment, the path can be explicitly set via the `mojo.modularHomePath`
extension setting.

```json
{
  "mojo.modularHomePath": "/absolute/path/to/.modular"
}
```

### Mojo SDK Resolution

Whenever you want to execute an action on a file, the extension will look for a
suitable Mojo SDK that can serve it. The search will start with the
`mojo.modularHomePath` setting of the file's Workspace, if available. Otherwise,
the extension will try the to use the same setting but at the User-level. Then,
it will try to use the `MODULAR_HOME` environment variable. If none of these
attempts works, the extension will fall back to use the `mojo.modularHomePath`
setting defined at the Workspace-level of any open Workspaces in the current
window. This is particularly useful if the user opens Mojo files that don't
belong to any active Workspace and wants to get some extension support.

## Debugger

A fully featured LLDB debugger is included with Mojo. You can press the down
arrow next to the `▶️` button in the top right of a Mojo file, and select
`Debug Mojo File`:

![debugging](https://github.com/modular/mojo/assets/77730378/45c547c3-8f08-4f8c-85a4-1254d12a09f5)

The default key is `F5`, and you can rebind the related hotkeys in Preferences:
Open Keyboard Shortcuts > `Debug: Start Debugging`

## Code Completion

To trigger a completion press `ctrl + space`, pressing `ctrl + space` again will
bring up doc hints:

![completion](https://github.com/modular/mojo/assets/77730378/51af7c47-8c39-449b-a759-8351c543208a)

Rebind the hotkey in Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts > `Trigger Suggest`

## Hover and Doc Hints

Hover over a symbol with your cursor for doc hints. The default hotkey
to trigger it in macOS is `⌘ + k`, `⌘ + i` or `ctrl + k`, `ctrl + i` in Linux
and Windows:

![hover](https://github.com/modular/mojo/assets/77730378/59881310-d2ec-481f-975a-d69d5e6c7ae3)

Rebind the hotkey in Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts >
`Show or Focus Hover`

## Signature Help

Mojo provides function overloading, so you need a way to scroll through the
multiple signatures available. You can bring this up with the hotkey
`⌘ + shift + space` in macOS or `ctrl + shift + space` in Linux or Windows.

![signature-help](https://github.com/modular/mojo/assets/77730378/3994ab6d-ae4b-43af-9ddf-0d979c51330f)

Rebind related hotkeys in Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts >
`Trigger Parameter Hints`

## Code Diagnostics

Code diagnostics are indicated with an underline on the code and details appear
when you hover. You can also see them in the `PROBLEMS` tab and use
`Go to Next Problem in Files` to quickly cycle through them:

![diagnostics2](https://github.com/modular/mojo/assets/77730378/b9d4c570-62da-4e82-981d-6d95ea8f34a2)

Rebind related hotkeys in Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts >
`Go to Next Problem...`

**Tip:** Also try the `Error Lens` extension (not associated with Modular),
which will display the first line of the diagnostic inline, making it easier
to quickly fix problems.

## Doc String Code Blocks

Unique to Mojo, you get a full LSP experience for code blocks inside doc
strings, with all the features mentioned here including completions and
diagnostics:

![doc-lsp](https://github.com/modular/mojo/assets/77730378/c2d73fd0-66de-44e7-8125-511bf0237396)

## Go to Symbol

You can quickly jump to a symbol in the file with `⌘ + shift + o` in macOS or
`ctrl + shift + o` in Linux and Windows.

![go-to-symbol](https://github.com/modular/mojo/assets/77730378/1972e611-4a01-4a7f-945d-a3b5f10034a9)

This also enables the outline view in the explorer window.

Rebind the hotkey in Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts >
`Go to Symbol in Editor`

## Quick Fix

If there is an available quick fix with the code diagnostic, click
the lightbulb icon or use the default hotkey `ctrl + .` for a list of options:

![quick-fix](https://github.com/modular/mojo/assets/77730378/b9bb1122-9fdc-4fbc-b3a8-28a54cd78704)

Rebind the hotkey in Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts >
`Quick Fix...`

## Run Mojo File

The extension provides a set of actions on the top-right of a Mojo file to run
the active file, which by default are under a small `▶️` button up the
top-right of the editor:

![run-file](https://github.com/modular/mojo/assets/77730378/22ef37cf-154a-430b-9ef3-427dbab411fc)

These actions are also available in the command palette and under the `Mojo`
submenu in the File Explorer when right-clicking on Mojo files:

![right-click-menu](https://github.com/modular/mojo/assets/77730378/b267a44c-fa2c-425d-bada-7360cd338351)

You may bind hotkeys to any of the actions listed here. For example, to bind a
hotkey for the "Run Mojo File" action, open preferences, then select
`Keyboard Shortcuts > Mojo: Run Mojo File`.

### Run Mojo File

This executes the current Mojo file in a terminal that is reused by other
invocations of this same action, even if they run a different file.

### Run Mojo File in Dedicated Terminal

This executes the current Mojo file in a dedicated terminal that is reused only
by subsequent runs of this very same file.

## Code Formatting

From the command palette run `Format Document` or tick the setting
`Format on Save`:

![format](https://github.com/modular/mojo/assets/77730378/4e0e22c4-0216-41d7-b5a5-7f48a018fd81)

## Restarting Mojo Extension

The extension may crash and produce incorrect results periodically, to fix this
from the command palette search for `Mojo: Restart the extension`

![restart](https://github.com/modular/mojo/assets/77730378/c65bf84b-5c9b-4151-8176-2b098533dbe3)

Bind a hotkey in Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts >
